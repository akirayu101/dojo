At the moment the time.now calls occur in the web service.
When web service has 3 replicas (swarm, k8s) then the times
are not g'teed to be consistent.
The simplest way to fix this is to set the time in the saver
service.
This would mean that tests for, eg the age of a kata would
need to be run with the SaverFake so you could use a TimeStub
(see app_models_test_base.rb)
