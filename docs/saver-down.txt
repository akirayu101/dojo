If saver is down you should be able to use cyber-dojo but with reduced
functionality.

1) setup - creation of a new session
- setup gets display_names from languages service
- user chooses a display_name
- setup runs: manifest = languages.manifest(display_name)
- setup fails to save this manifest to saver, saver raises specific exception
- so web has to
  - allocate the id itself 999999?
  - redirect to kata/edit which is populated directly from the manifest and not the id
  - redirect_to allows additional parameters
  -   def save_individual
        kata = katas.new_kata(starter_manifest)
        redirect_to "/kata/edit/#{kata.id}"
      rescue SaverError
        redirect_to "/kata/edit/999999", manifest:starter_manifest
      end


2) running the tests
- if kata.ran_tests(...) fails because saver is down
- get saver-service to raise specific saver-error exception
- trap this
- browser has to
  - know save fails
  - add message to footer
  - not switch to diff view of the [test] run
