If you are working on web-service there are 2 ways of
getting feedback on your local work:

1) /build_test_tag_publish.sh
   This runs a local server, using commander, but substitutes the
   locally build web image. The slowest option, but very close
   to how it actually runs.

2) /sh/dev_run_server.sh
   This runs a local server but does not use the commander service.
   Instead it uses docker-compose, versioner, and its own docker-compose
   yml files. The web image is rebuilt from source.
   A lot quicker than using commander (1), but not how a local server
   actually runs. A good (short) feedback loop for eg CSS tweaking.
